#Overview

An electron app that listens to events published by multiple Particle Photons, each attached to a door sensor on a different restroom, to inform the user when a toilet is available or not.

Based on Brent Ertz's ocupado-app (https://github.com/brentertz/ocupado-app).

#Set up:

At the root of the directory, run:
npm install

And then, to get the toolbar app running:
npm start

To stop the app, select Quit from the menu or, in your terminal, enter:
Ctrl + C
